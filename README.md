It is more important to speak to why you made a decition that macking the "right" choice.

## Business requirements
There is a simple card game called [war](https://www.bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/). With some modifications:
1. In stead of deviding one deck the dealer will hold onto the cards
2. The dealer will play with 4 decks and shuffle all 4 decks together so we will have 4 of every card mixed into 4 decks.
3. For simplicity if there is a tie the dealer and player will take there respective cards.
4. Instead of dealing all the cards, after 10 rounds a winner is declared (the person with the most cards)
5. Multiple players can play at the same time.
6. Each player will initiate the round by asking the dealer to deal one card for the player and one card for the dealer.
